Dr Howard speaks about the availability and quality of American children's literature, a topic she believes to be relevant to both Australian and American parents. She considers the wealth of quality books and authors and the ways in which children can access and enjoy this material. Dr Howard continues with her primary concern, the need to limit children's access to comic books. She discusses the role parents and teachers can play in ensuring their children read works of literary merit citing examples of successful boycotts. Dr Howard concludes with a reflection on the similarities of pedagogical debates taking place in Australia and America. \n\nOne of a collection of interviews of children\u2019s folklorist Dr Dorothy Howard in 1954-1955, as well as a lecture she delivered.

Beckham addressed to Dr Dorothy Howard on 7 July 1954. In her letter to Dr Howard, Beckham describes a number of games played during her childhood in Maldon and the Mallee country in rural Victoria. She writes that all games were unsupervised and involved finding free materials in the surrounding environment. For example, the ball games 'Ducks' and 'Rotten Eggs' involved a tennis ball and many stones, the latter being plentiful in the rocky mining town of Maldon. Beckham states that she was introduced to a new set of games following her family's relocation to the dry and sandy Mallee country. She writes that Knucklebones and 'Jacks' were quiet, cool games suitable for play in the hot Mallee summers. All descriptions include the number of players involved, the equipment needed and the rules. \n\nOne of a collection of letters describing a children\u2019s game written to children\u2019s Folklorist Dorothy Howard between 1954 and 1955.

Browning provides Dr Howard with examples, photographs and information of the string games that she and fellow teacher Mary Kitchen have observed being played by 12 year old students. She writes that 'Cat's Cradle' is the name used by adults to describe string games, stating that children use terminology such as 'Cup and Saucer', 'Parachute' and 'Sydney Harbour Bridge' to describe the shapes created with the string. Browning claims that string games are commonly played in the school yard, in class before school, while waiting for public transport and at home in late autumn and spring.\nShe continues with information about the enclosed photographs which feature, with the consent of their parents, Andrea Napthine and Rosemary Robertson. \n\nOne of a collection of letters describing a children\u2019s game written to children\u2019s Folklorist Dorothy Howard between 1954 and 1955.

Dr Howard writes in response to a letter previously received from Dr Factor requesting information about her Australian fieldwork and subsequent American projects. Her letter serves as a prelude to Dr Factor's visit to Roswell with Naomi, providing information on her early career and view of the playground as an educational institution. Dr Howard highlights the influence of Jean Piaget and Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss on the progression of her interests, theories and methodology. She discusses her research into the relationship between teachers and their pupils, questioning the value of passive educational models in which children simply receive knowledge. Dr Howard argues that her research of the folklore of the classroom may assist in redefining this relationship and encourage new ways of teaching. \n\nAt Dr Factor's request, Dr Howard includes an accompanying, typed document titled 'Projects in Progress', which outlines her major projects following her visit to Australia. These include: 'Maryland Mennonite Children Play', 'Kissing Kin', 'Broken Bow', and 'Odyssey of a Country Teacher'. She elaborates on her study of the Mexican child Pedro Munoz in her letter. For this project Dr Howard repeatedly visited Munoz during the 1960s and 1970s to observe his play, a methodology which differed considerably from the general or in her terms \"tourist\" survey of Australian children's play traditions. Dr Howard concludes her letter with questions about Dr Factor's research and a brief outline of her various roles and contributions to a state college in Maryland and the University of Nebraska. \n\nOne of a collection of letters written to and from children\u2019s Folklorist Dr Dorothy Howard between 1954 and 1995. Dr Howard came to Australia in 1954-55 as an American Fulbright scholar to study Australian children's folklore.

After reading about Dr Howard's research project in a local newspaper, Giffen compiled a collection of games, rhymes and jingles played by children in northern Queensland, especially the region between Bowen and Cairns. In the introductory page of her letter, she considers the impact of the tropical Queensland climate on the types of games played by children, suggesting a tendency for indoor, seated games as well as highlighting the limited access to educational resources such as libraries. Giffen also mentions her personal interest in recording Australian folk stories and songs, largely gleaned from her great grandparent's generation. The subsequent five pages comprise detailed descriptions of the various games, particularly rhyming games. Two of the games 'Beamy' and 'Corners', which appear to be unique to Queensland, are accompanied by explanatory illustrations and diagrams. Giffen also provides a list of popular terminology used by children in particular games and more generally.\n\nOne of a collection of letters written to and from children\u2019s Folklorist Dr Dorothy Howard between 1954 and 1995.

Beales writes to Dr Howard after reading about her Australian research project in the 'School Magazine'. He discusses his teaching experience and his perception of students in Victoria, Queensland, New Zealand, England and Scotland. He writes about the popularity of Australian Rules Football amongst youth in Victoria, stating that the absence of a proper ball can be remedied with a pig's bladder or a bundle of rubbish tied together. Beales lists some games played seasonally in Victoria including spinning tops and the marbles game 'Allies'. He states that other games such as 'Fly the Garter', 'Egg Cap', 'Kick the Tins', 'Duck Stone', 'Prisoner's Base', Rounders, Hockey Australian Rules and hoops are played all year. Beales continues with an analysis of the impact of Roman Catholic schooling on the behaviour and games played by children in Queensland. In conclusion, he discusses his own 'Scottish' style of education, which encouraged children to pursue their interests and skills irrespective of the standard curriculum. \n\nOne of a collection of letters written to and from children\u2019s Folklorist Dr Dorothy Howard between 1954 and 1995.

Amos provides general descriptions of Hopscotch and 'Treasure Hunt' before discussing the games in detail. She states that Hopscotch is a popular girls game played during winter in the school grounds. Amos writes that 'Treasure Hunt' is played by boys and girls in the summer months in the back gardens of children's homes. She lists some of the friends who also play these games including Dawn Duffy, Pamela Watson and Carole Campbell. \n\nAmos describes the hopscotch patterns 'Snail Hop Scotch' and 'Aeroplane Hop Scotch' in detail, providing annotated, hand drawn diagrams of each variation. To play 'Snail Hop Scotch', Amos writes that players draw a snail-like pattern on the ground, marking bases throughout the course. As each player hops their way through the course, they write their initials in the different bases reached. Amos explains that the game continues until all the bases have been claimed by the players. She notes that landing in another player's base or on a line results in elimination from the game. Similarly, 'Aeroplane Hop Scotch' is drawn on the ground and the bases are numbered from one to eight. Players use taws, incorrectly spelt 'tores', presumably to mark out their course through the hopscotch pattern. Amos notes that players are eliminated if they land in a square occupied by another player, land in another player's base or step on a line. To play the seeking game 'Treasure Hunt', Amos writes that one player writes out a series of clues on slips of paper, which provide information about the location of a hidden treasure. The player places the clues throughout a course before providing an initial clue to the other children, who have been waiting with their eyes closed. The other players must locate each clue in order to find the final prize. Amos lists some examples of possible clues, providing an annotated diagram.\n\nOne of a collection of letters describing a children\u2019s game written to children\u2019s Folklorist Dorothy Howard between 1954 and 1955.

Taggart describes 'Giant's Treasure' and 'Creepings Up' as games suitable for children aged between five and twelve years, which are played all year round in backyards, school grounds and indoors. To play 'Giant's Treasure', she writes that a child is nominated as the 'giant', who must guard a treasure comprising a ball or stone. Taggart explains that the 'giant' stands with their treasure at their feet and their back to the approaching players, who must stand still each time the 'giant' turns around. The objective of the approaching players to steal the treasure from the 'giant' and returning to the starting line without being caught.  Similarly, 'Creepings Up' involves players slowly approaching 'he' in an attempt to touch this player. Taggart states that if 'he' sees a player move, they must return to the starting line.

Dr Howard introduces the concept of folklore, describing it as the lore of people or their traditional ways, which have been handed down orally through generations. More than just folk songs and tales, she argues that folklore encompasses beliefs, traditional customs, daily routines and her particular interest, children's play. Dr Howard explores the similarities and differences between children's games across the world before examining the play of Australian children. She discusses the common misconception that all Australian children's play traditions originated in the British Isles, citing several uniquely Australian games. Similarly, Dr Howard challenges the belief that Australian children no longer play traditional games, preferring organised sports, reading comics, watching movies or playing war games. She argues that her research indicates the continued popularity of traditional games in Australia. Dr Howard concludes with a request for people to contact her about their childhood games.\n\nOne of a collection of interviews of children\u2019s folklorist Dr Dorothy Howard in 1954-1955, as well as a lecture she delivered.

Bieske, a 21 year old man from Horsham, to Dr Dorothy Howard circa 1954-55. In his letter to Dr Howard, Bieske describes a number of games played during his childhood in rural Victoria. Bieske's descriptions include the number of players, the props involved, the rules, an instructive diagram and the games' popularity with the different genders. He comments on the seasons and locations in which particular games are played. For example Bieske describes the elimination game 'Spin the Plate', which involves players trying to retrieve a spinning play before it falls, as suitable for indoor and outdoor play particularly in winter. The individuals, G(?). Huile, Don Rushbrook, N. Linten-Smith, John Wangmann, appear to have also contributed to the description of this game. Another example of a game popular with boys in country Victoria is 'Crawling Hide and Seek'. According to Bieske, this game involves tunnelling through fields of long grass until spotted by the seeker and thus, it is a game suitable for early summer when the grass is particularly long. Bieske explains several other games including 'Quoit', 'Skittles' and the ball games 'Queenie', 'Sick, Dying, Dead' and 'Donkey'. \n\nOne of a collection of letters describing a children\u2019s game written to children\u2019s Folklorist Dorothy Howard between 1954 and 1955.

Brann describes 'Noughts and Crosses' as a game requiring two players aged nine and above, which can be played all year in many locations. She lists some of the children she plays with including Penny Royle, Jan Moorhouse, Lyn Parker and her brother Geoff. To play, players select either 'noughts' or 'crosses', taking turns to enter these symbols into a nine square grid. Brann explains that the game's objective is to achieve a row of three, matching symbols. She provides several hand drawn diagrams illustrating different ways in which a player can win. Brann notes that if all squares have been filled and neither player has won, the game is called a 'Jack'.\n\nBrann describes a variation of the same game called 'Noughts and Crosses on Chairs'. She writes that this version is usually played indoors at social groups such as the 'Girls Friendly Society'. Instead of drawing the nine square grid on paper, players recreate the layout using chairs to represent each square. Brann provides a detailed, annotated diagram illustrating the game's configuration and the position of the players. She writes that players form two teams and each member is allocated a number. One child assumes the role of 'caller', announcing the different numbers. The corresponding children rush to secure the best chairs for their team. To differentiate between the two teams, Brann states that one team sits on the chairs and the other stands. As with 'Noughts and Crosses', the first team to secure a row of three squares is declared the winner. \n\nOne of a collection of letters describing a children\u2019s game written to children\u2019s Folklorist Dorothy Howard between 1954 and 1955.

She provides several annotated, hand drawn diagrams illustrating the game's lay out and progression. To play, a shallow hole, known as the 'Goot', is dug in the ground at which players aim their marbles. Once the order of play is determined, Cory explains that players aim to land their marbles in the 'Goot'.

Marshall describes 'Hopo Bumpo' as a game requiring a minimum of three players aged between eight and twelve years, which is played in all seasons usually in a backyard or sometimes at school. She writes that parallel boundaries are determined with players lining up along one side. One child stands in the central space facing the other players. Marshall explains that the central child calls out the name of one player, who must try to reach the other boundary whilst hopping on one leg with their arms crossed. The child in the middle chases the player, mimicking their actions, and attempts to knock them over.  Marshall provides an annotated, hand drawn illustration of the game's layout and progression.

Pankervis describes 'Poison Ball' and 'Callings Up' as games requiring players aged between eight and fourteen years of age, which are played in all seasons in streets, parks and halls. To play 'Poison Ball', she states that two players stand at the far ends of a predetermined, rectangular area, as indicated by her hand drawn diagram. The players throw a ball between them, taking aim at the other children standing in the centre. If a child is hit by the passing ball, they are eliminated from the game. Pankervis explains the various scenarios which occur if the ball is caught by a player in the centre or by a child at one of the ends. Pankervis also discusses 'Callings Up', stating that each player selects a name of a plant, flower, animal, country or car. She states that a ball is thrown and a name called out. The corresponding child collects the ball and requests the other players to 'stand!'. The child attempts to throw the ball at the stationary players. If hit by the ball, the player accumulates a letter from the word 'DONKEY'. Pankervis notes that the game continues until all players have accrued the letters of 'DONKEY'. She lists other players of 'Poison Ball' and 'Callings Up' including Margaret Pankervis, John Pankervis, Judy Backhouse, Margot Wheaton, Russell Sholer, Fiona Nicolls, Diana Nicolls, Pam Prichard, Merry Hughes, David Sholer and Russell Sholer. \n\nOne of a collection of letters describing a children\u2019s game written to children\u2019s Folklorist Dorothy Howard between 1954 and 1955.

Beckham addressed to Dr Dorothy Howard on 7 July 1954. In her letter to Dr Howard, Beckham describes a number of games played during her childhood in Maldon and the Mallee country in rural Victoria. She writes that all games were unsupervised and involved finding free materials in the surrounding environment. For example, the ball games 'Ducks' and 'Rotten Eggs' involved a tennis ball and many stones, the latter being plentiful in the rocky mining town of Maldon. Beckham states that she was introduced to a new set of games following her family's relocation to the dry and sandy Mallee country. She writes that Knucklebones and 'Jacks' were quiet, cool games suitable for play in the hot Mallee summers. All descriptions include the number of players involved, the equipment needed and the rules. \n\nOne of a collection of letters describing a children\u2019s game written to children\u2019s Folklorist Dorothy Howard between 1954 and 1955.

She explains that although the confines of her Fulbright scholarship prevent her from undertaking extensive research into the area, she is eager to learn more about Aboriginal children's games after visiting Sydney's La Perouse School and reading publications by Charles Mountford (incorrectly spelt 'Mumford') and Walter Roth on the subject. In particular, Dr Howard seeks examples of the influence of Aboriginal games on those of non-Indigenous children. Dr Howard proceeds with questions regarding the types of games played by Aboriginal children at the Mission. She writes that Miss Roberts, an employee in the Foreign Mission Office, showed her photographs depicting children playing with leaves and an Aboriginal teacher working at the Mission. She asks if this teacher could provide a detailed list of her students games.\n\nOne of a collection of letters written to and from children\u2019s Folklorist Dr Dorothy Howard between 1954 and 1995.

In dot point format, Lewis discusses details about how and where the game is played and its players. He also provides an annotated diagram of the game's layout. According to Lewis, 'Around the Posts' has been popular with all children aged nine years and over in the Adelaide Hills since 1925. Played at the intersection of two roads, children must run between four posts, which are placed at each corner, without being caught by the chaser. Lewis lists the following four names: Beepy Lewis, Jocko Couts, Falty [?] Jones and Chappie Chapman.

Paterson describes the hiding game 'Hide and Seek', which is played by two teams of children. To play, one team hides while the opposing group counts to 500 before attempting to find those hidden. Tait describes the hiding games 'Bang' and 'Sardines'. 'Bang' requires more than two players. One child counts while the other players hide. If caught, a child is taken to the 'home' base by the seeker. The captured child can be freed by other players and re-hide. Tait describes 'Sardines' as a game requiring more than three players. She writes that one child hides, while the other children count. When a seeker locates the hidden child, they must join them in their hiding place. Overell discusses the guessing game 'Animal Noises', which can be played by an number of children. She writes that players sit in a circle except for one child, who stands outside the ring with their back to the group. Taking in turns, the seated children make animal noises and the standing child must guess the identity of the player responsible.\n\nOne of a collection of letters describing a children\u2019s games written to children\u2019s Folklorist Dorothy Howard between 1954 and 1955.

Murchison describes 'Letters', a language game she plays with her sibling and neighbours on the weekend. One child stands with their back to the other players and calls out letters. If the name of the other players contains the letter, they take a step forward. The first to reach the caller wins. Murchison discusses 'Spelling Game', a game she enjoys with her family in the evenings. One person calls out a letter with subsequent players adding letters in order to create a word. Players aim to make the word as long as possible. She also describes the ball and number game 'Donkey'. Each player is allocated a number before they start running around. If their number is called out, they receive a ball to throw at the nearest child. Each time a child is hit by the ball, they acquire a letter from the word 'donkey'. If the thrower misses, they accumulate the letters. Vickery describes the language game 'Countries', which involves one child naming a country. The next player must name a country beginning with the last letter of the previous country. She also discusses the elimination game 'Elimination Walk'. To play, Vickery writes that pairs of children march around a room to music. One child remains to the side calling out physical characteristics, such as 'red dress'. If a player features the named attribute, they are eliminated along with their partner. \n\nOne of a collection of letters describing a children\u2019s games written to children\u2019s Folklorist Dorothy Howard between 1954 and 1955.

Skinner describes 'Fruit Games' which involves placing the peel of an orange or apple under the top lip of a player, who proceeds to show their fruit covered teeth. Dodd discusses the running game 'Fruit Salad', providing annotated, hand drawn diagrams. To play, children are divided into teams of fruit and seated in rows. The names of different fruit are called out and the corresponding team runs around the other players, the fastest player accumulating points. When 'Fruit Salad' is called, all teams run with the fastest group winning the game. 'Apple Game' and 'Biting the Apple', described respectively by Murchison and Kinlock, involve players biting apples hanging from string with their hands behind their backs. Kinlock states that 'Biting the Apple' is usually played by girls. Watson provides a description of 'Buy My Supper'. She writes that one player is elected the bride or groom, requesting the other players to get their supper. The fastest to procure the request becomes the corresponding spouse. \n\nOne of a collection of letters describing a children\u2019s games written to children\u2019s Folklorist Dorothy Howard between 1954 and 1955.

Vickery describes the rules of the ball game 'Beam', which involves two players placed on either side of a wooden beam usually located under an elevated house. If a player's ball rebounds off the beam and they catch it, they score a point. If the ball misses the beam or passes over to the other side, the opponent scores. Park describes 'Tens' as a popular school game involving two players. Players take turns to bounce a ball in sets of declining number beginning at ten. Similarly, 'Sevens' involves bouncing a ball against a wall in groups of diminishing number beginning at seven. Described by Christison, 'Sevens' can be played by any number of girls.

Another player jumps from side to side over the rope until they fail to clear it. 'Chase the Fox' is also a girls' game played all year round. Brown states that a skipping rope is swung between two players while the remaining children run underneath performing increasingly difficult physical actions. If a player is touched by the rope, they replace one of the children holding its ends. Brown notes that she has played these games between 1951 and 1954.

She describes it as a game used to discover who Mother More's daughter will marry, copying out the accompanying rhyme. Skinner describes the marbles game 'Shooting the Marbles', which requires a board covered with nails. She includes two, small, hand drawn diagrams to illustrate the game's layout and discusses the rules. Using a ring, players shoot marbles through the maze of nails scoring points. Skinner writes that the game can be purchased ready-made. Hughes discusses the marbles game 'Checkers', describing the appearance of the board used.

Hall describes 'Musical Chairs', which appears under the category of 'Dance Games' together with 'Musical Arms'. She writes that 'Musical Chairs' is a popular party game. To play, chairs are lined up totalling one less than the number of players. The children circle the chairs dancing to music. When the music stops, players rush to procure a chair risking elimination if they are unsuccessful. Hall notes that she played this game in Brisbane in 1954. Brown describes 'Musical Arms' as a game requiring an uneven number of players, usually girls, dancing to music. When the music stops, players must locate a partner or be eliminated from the game. Brown writes that she played this game in 1953. Butler discusses 'Cat and the Mouse', which involves a circle of players linked by their arms. In the centre, a 'cat' is selected from the players who must to chase another child, the 'mouse'.

Fahl also discusses 'Fiddlesticks', which involves players removing sticks from a large pile without moving any of the neighbouring sticks. Hutton describes 'Fly', which involves spacing apart ten sticks as illustrated by her hand drawn illustration in red pencil. She writes that 'Fly' is played by three players, who are allocated the role of 'cobweb', 'spider' and 'fly'. The game's rules are not clearly articulated; however, it appears that each player must jump as far as possible into the spaces between the sticks, possibly seeking to out jump of the other players.

She writes that players throw the knucklebones into the air, catching them alternatively in their palm or on the back of their hand. As the game progresses, more knucklebones are added into the play until all five are thrown and caught. Drake describes 'Dog and the Bone', which involves two teams of equal numbers and is played outdoors. The players are allocated numbers and line up opposite the opposing team as indicated by Drake's hand drawn diagram. In between the teams, a bone is placed.

Hall describes 'Paper Chase', which involves one player leaving a trail of paper pieces as they run away. Other players seek out the 'trail-layer', whose path is often confused by false trails. She also discusses 'Walking Over Eggs', a game she saw played in Brisbane in 1953. To play, she writes that five eggs are lined up a foot apart. A player is blindfolded and the eggs replaced secretly with non-breakable items. The blindfolded player must step between the eggs, fearing they will crush them. Hodgson describes the hiding game 'Blindman's Bluff', which involves a blindfolded player seeking the other, hidden players using only their hands. Dodd describes a popular party game, 'The Egg and Spoon Race'. To play, children line up with an egg on a spoon. Players attempt to run to the finishing line of the course without the egg falling to the ground.\n\nOne of a collection of letters describing a children\u2019s games written to children\u2019s Folklorist Dorothy Howard between 1954 and 1955.

Players indicate whether the seeker is getting closer to the coin's location by saying 'hot' or 'cold'. Paddy Hutton describes 'A Wedding Ring', which involves players forming a circle with one child remaining to the side. A ring is placed on a loop of string and hidden amongst the group for the remaining child to locate. If successfully located, the child exchanges places with the bearer of the ring. Fay Hutton lists some examples of play involving coins. She writes that a coin can be tossed to determine who begins a game or coins can be thrown into a stream for children to locate.

Skinner describes 'Flipping the Shilling', a game which involves balancing a card with a coin on top of your middle finger.

Its Director is Dr June Factor, a Senior Fellow of the Australian Centre, University of Melbourne.\n\nFrom 1989 - 1999 the Collection was housed in the University of Melbourne Archives, and in June 1999 it was donated by Dr Factor to Museum Victoria, where it became a key element in the Museum's existing Childhood Collection, which is administered by the History & Technology Department. Dr Factor and Dr Davey continue to be closely involved with the Collection.\n\nAbout the Collection: The ACFC is unique, documenting contemporary children's folklore across Australia and in other countries, reaching back to the 1870s. There is also a strong component of research material from Victoria. Work of the renowned American folklorist, Dr Dorothy Howard, including significant Australian material, is included in the Collection. The ACFC is rich in the documentation of childhood in the cultures of different immigrant groups to Australia. Its contents tell of the negotiation of difference and conformity by children, and of key issues of Australian identity, particularly over the last 30 years.\n\nThe Australian Children's Folklore Collection classifies folklore as either folklore of children, or folklore for and about children, depending on whether the main persons transmitting the lore are children or adults. Folklore of children consists largely of play lore, such as rhymes, games, taunts, jokes and riddles. Folklore for and about children consists of those traditional songs, games, finger plays, stories, proverbs and sayings that are passed on informally by adults.\n\nPlay and Folklore, a publication with both overseas and Australian subscribers, is published twice a year in conjunction with the ACFC. The archive has also produced a number of publications under the imprint: Australian Children's Folklore Publications.", "collectionNames": ["Australian Children's Folklore Collection", "Dorothy Howard Collection"], "audioVisualRecordingDetails": null, "dateModified": "2015-09-09T12:03:00", "isdDescriptionOfContent": null, "relatedSpecimenIds": [], "audioVisualContentSummaries": [], "numismaticsReverseDescription": null, "modelScale": null, "typeStatus": null, "objectSummary": "Index cards, letters and photographs collected or written by Dr Dorothy Howard. \n\nDr Dorothy Howard came to Australia in 1954-55 as an American Fulbright scholar to study Australian children's folklore.

Archdeacon writes that 'Hip' is one of his favourite games as it involves a large number of players running in an open space. According to Archdeacon, players select a number from a set range, which is disclosed to a nominated child. In the interim, another child is handed a stick and told to wait at a distance until all the numbers have been allocated. The child with the stick returns to the group and calls out a number. The corresponding player is pronounced 'Hip'. 'Hip's' role is to chase the other players. Captured players assist 'Hip' by catching remaining players and holding them until 'Hip' can tag them. The game continues until all players are caught.\n\nOne of a collection of letters describing a children\u2019s games written to children\u2019s Folklorist Dorothy Howard between 1954 and 1955.

If 'He' locates a player, he must return to the home base can yell out the child's name and 'One two three, home'.

Craig describes 'French and English' as a common game which can be played in a large room or outside. To play, she writes that two teams are established, each with a captain. The teams stand opposite each other in rows. A player from one group approaches the opposition, tapping all on the back of the hand but one, who they tap (presumably) on the palm. The selected child must chase the player back to their team. If the chaser fails to catch the player before they return to their team, they are classified as a 'half cast' until recaptured by their own team.

To begin two captains select teams, who stand facing each other at a distance of forty feet apart with their hands extended.

In Stone's example, the French captain approaches the English team, tapping all players on the palm but one, who they touch on the back on the hand.

Chapman writes that if more than four players are involved, 'he' is permitted to run with the ball. If the number is less, 'he' must stand still and throw that the ball at the running players.

According to Richardson, 'Brandy All Over' is played by a group of girls and boys, preferably six years and over, in a school yard. Two players, the chasers, stand in the centre of the yard. One of the chasers stands with their foot on a ball while counting to twenty. The other chaser joins the rest of the children, who are running around the ground.  The game's rules are slightly unclear; however, it appears that the child with the ball passes it to the other chaser, who must throw it at the children running. Richardson lists other players of 'Brandy All Over': Ann Wescombe, Janice Williams, Meredith Ward, Robin Eaden, Denis Heath, Robert Such, Allen Hammat, Bruce Lane and John Tellick.\n\nOne of a collection of letters describing a children\u2019s games written to children\u2019s Folklorist Dorothy Howard between 1954 and 1955.

Michailovs describes 'Brandy' as a game requiring a soft rubber ball, a large outdoor space, and any number of children aged over eight years. He writes that numerous methods can be used to determine the chaser, 'he'. Michailovs describes his preferred method, which involves players standing in a circle with their toes pointing inwards. A ball is dropped into the centre. The child touched by the ball is pronounced 'he man'. 'He man' must chase the other players, throwing the ball at them as they run. Captured players must assist 'he' to chase the remaining children.

Pollard writes that one player is elected the 'speaker' and must stand in the centre of the space facing the other players, who are lined up a few paces away. The 'speaker' selects any word, such a film character, car model or a flower, and announces the initial(s) of the chosen word to the other players.

Another player copies out the alphabet in mixed order onto their sheet. With eyes closed this player, points to a letter at random.

Garten describes how each game is played, providing annotated, hand drawn and coloured diagrams. In the marbles game 'Triangle', Garten writes that players place marbles in a triangle drawn on the ground before determining which child will throw first. Garten's description is somewhat unclear; however, it appears that the successful player throws their marbles at those within the triangle in an attempt to land them close by. He describes 'Dodge' as a ball game involving three or more boys standing in a group. Another player throws a large rubber ball at the group, who must dodge it or face elimination from the game. To play the card game 'Grab', Garten writes that two players divide evenly a pack of cards before taking turns to place a card face upwards on a table. If a pair of cards appear, players race to place their hand on the cards and say 'grab'.

To play 'What's The Time Mr Wolf', Cook writes that one child is elected 'Mr Wolf' while the other players, the 'lambs', line up at the home base. The 'lambs' repeatedly call out 'What's the time Mr Wolf?', who answers with different times. With each response, the 'lambs' approach 'Mr Wolf' until 'Dinner time' is called and they are chased back to the home base. If caught, the 'lambs' become 'little wolves' and assist with the chasing. Cook also describes 'Rats and Rabbits', a game involving two teams. One team is elected the chasers, who proceed to chase their opponents until all players are captured.

Harding describes how each game is played, providing detailed descriptions of the accompanying physical actions and rhymes. To play 'Tens', she writes that participants bounce a ball in sets of declining number beginning at ten and ending at one. Each set is accompanied by increasingly complex actions primarily involving clapping. Similarly, 'Sevens' involves bouncing two balls against a wall in sets of declining number beginning at seven and ending at one. Each set is accompanied by increasingly complex actions such as throwing one ball in the air and the other against the wall. Harding discusses the physical actions associated with the rhyme in 'Drunken Sailor'. In each verse, particular words are a cue for players to throw the ball into the air.\n\nOne of a collection of letters describing a children\u2019s games written to children\u2019s Folklorist Dorothy Howard between 1954 and 1955.

Powell describes 'British Bulldogs' as a rough game usually played by boys, which any number can play. He writes that a large, grassy area is preferable as it lessens the chance of injury during falls. To play, a captain selects a 'he-man', the chaser, while the other players line up against a wall. 'He-man' calls out the names of players, who must try to reach the opposite end of the field without being caught. Powell notes that captured players assist 'he-man' to catch other players, noting that the game often results in brawls as children try to avoid 'he-man' and his assistants.\n\nOne of a collection of letters describing a children\u2019s games written to children\u2019s Folklorist Dorothy Howard between 1954 and 1955.

Campbell writes that 'Donkey' requires a ball, some chalk and a maximum of eight players. He states that a wide, quiet road is the preferred location to play. To play, a large, chalk circle is drawn at the centre of the street and divided equally into sections. A child is elected 'he', who allocates a section and a number to each player. The game's rules are somewhat unclear; however, it appears that 'he' bounces the ball in the circle's centre and calls out a number. All the players, except for the child whose number was called, must run as far as possible before 'he' catches the ball. Campbell explains that 'he' takes three strides towards the closest player, throwing the ball at them. If hit, the player must write the letter 'd' in their section of the circle. He notes that each hit results in the accumulation of another letter until 'DONKEY' is spelt. \n\nOne of a collection of letters describing a children\u2019s games written to children\u2019s Folklorist Dorothy Howard between 1954 and 1955.

Two captains select teams of about twelve players. One team forms the English team, the other the French team. Makin explains that the two teams form rows about fifty yards apart. The French team stand with their palms turned downwards; the English team turn their palms upwards. Makin writes that a member of the English team approaches the French team, touching all players on the top of their hands except for one, who they touch on their down turned palm. This player must chase the English child back to their team.

The author describes 'Ship, Shore, Submarine' as a game requiring an open space, a minimum of three players, and three pieces of cardboard featuring a ship, a shore, or a submarine. The drawing of the shore is placed in the centre of the space with the other images placed at each end. One player assumes the role of 'speaker'. The author provides an example of the type of statement made by the speaker: 'When I was on the shore, I saw the ship'. In response, the players must move to the image of the shore and face in the direction of the ship. The author notes that the speaker's objective is to confuse the other players into making an error, noting that the last player to avoid elimination is declared the winner.\n\nOne of a collection of letters describing a children\u2019s games written to children\u2019s Folklorist Dorothy Howard between 1954 and 1955.

The chaser runs after the other players, attempting to 'tip' or touch them. If successful, Doyle notes that the captured player must hold onto the 'chaser' in the exact position that they were touched.

She lists some of the other players of 'Stations' including Cecily Cohen, Margaret Murdoch, Marilyn Jordan, Beverley Brown, Elizabeth Boyd, and Joyce Rudd. To play, Boyd writes that players form a circle and each select a name of a different railway station. One child sits on a chair at the circle's centre; another remains outside the group of players and calls out two or three station names at a time. Boyd explains that the corresponding children must exchanges places with each other before the child seated in the centre can obtain one of their positions within the circle.

She lists other players of these games including Dianne Callister, Judith Amos, Carole Campbell and Dawn Duffy. To play 'Blind Man's Buff', Callister writes that a blindfolded child counts to fifty before trying to locate the other players, who are moving noiselessly around them. She explains that if the blindfolded child must correctly identifies a player, the two children exchange roles. To play 'Hide and Seek', Callister states that a child counts to one hundred while the other players hide amongst the vegetation. The child begins their search for the hidden players, who are attempting to reach the 'home base' unseen. Callister notes that if the child suspects that they are approaching a hidden player, they recite the following 'The monkey is alert'.\n\nOne of a collection of letters describing a children\u2019s game written to children\u2019s Folklorist Dorothy Howard between 1954 and 1955.

Hacke describes 'Duster Hockey' as a game requiring a minimum of seven players, two chairs, two sticks measuring one foot six inches, and a rag or duster, which is played indoors in autumn, winter and spring. She notes that the number of players must be uneven as one child assumes the role of 'caller'; the remaining players are divided into two teams and allocated a number. Hacke discusses the game's setup, providing an annotated, hand drawn diagram to clarify her description. To play 'Duster Hockey', the 'caller' announces two numbers. The corresponding players, who are lined up in teams eight feet apart, collect a stick each and approach the rag or duster in the middle of the room. Hacke explains that the players' objective is to hit the rag or duster with the stick beneath one of the chairs. She states that the successful player scores a point for their team. Hacke lists other players of 'Duster Hockey' including Anne Crane, Judy Furphy, Jenny Greison, Cath Horsefall and other members of the Girl Guide Company. \n\nOne of a collection of letters describing a children\u2019s game written to children\u2019s Folklorist Dorothy Howard between 1954 and 1955.

Harrison describes 'Tip the Finger' as a popular girls game requiring a minimum of three players aged between eight and twelve, which is played on the street or in a playground all year round.  A player assumes the role of 'he' and stands with her back to the other children. A child approaches 'he' and draws a circle on her back with a fingertip. Harrison writes that 'he' must identify the child who touched her back. In response, the other players recite 'How many does she have to count, and where does she have to go?'. Harrison explains that 'he' names a number and location; however, if 'he' incorrectly identified the child, 'he' must count to the specified number and run to the location while the other children hide. 'He' proceeds to locate the hidden players, exchanging roles with the first child discovered.

Hope describes 'Snail Hoppy' as a game played by girls aged between 8 and 12 years in the school grounds during winter. She discusses the hopscotch pattern, which requires approximately thirty squares in a snail shell pattern, and provides an annotated, hand drawn diagram to illustrate her description. To play 'Snail Hoppy', players must hop to the centre of the hopscotch pattern and return to the beginning without stepping on a line or overbalancing. If successful, Hope explains that players repeat the process twice by jumping then 'scissors' jumping with legs crossed. If players complete the course successfully each time, they write their initials in one of the squares. Hope notes that no other player may stand in a square in which another's initials are marked; thus the game becomes increasingly difficult as more players occupy the squares.

Howlett describes 'Throw them to the Wolves' as a game requiring six balls and players aged between six and fourteen, which is played outside on a street during winter. She writes that the game is founded on the experiences of travellers, who have been attacked by wolves. To play, the slowest runner assumes the role of the 'traveller' and receives six balls to be used to divert the attention of the wolves. Howlett explains that the 'traveller' runs towards a predetermined safe location and is chased by the other players, who have become the wolves. If the 'traveller' throws a ball, the closest wolf must collect it before resuming the chase. Howlett states the game concludes when the 'traveller' reaches safety or is captured.

Prentice describes 'Drop the Handkerchief' as a game requiring a handkerchief which is played by children aged between four and twelve years in backyards or indoors all year. To play, she explains that players form a circle and recite a rhyme while a child runs around the outside of the group carrying a handkerchief. When the final lines of the rhyme are reached, the child drops the handkerchief and runs back to the place in the circle. Prentice states that as the child passes by, players must look behind them to see if the handkerchief has been dropped. If so, they must collect the handkerchief and race the child to their position in the group. Prentice notes that if they reach the space first, the child becomes a 'plum' and sits in the circle's centre.  She lists names of other players of 'Drop the Handkerchief' including Faye White, Judith Gordon, Maree Stone, Janice Pinchen, and Carole Moore.\n\nOne of a collection of letters describing a children\u2019s game written to children\u2019s Folklorist Dorothy Howard between 1954 and 1955.

Essentially, players begin with five jacks in their palm which are thrown into the air and caught on the back of the hand. Wingrove notes that if a player fails to catch any of the jacks, they must allow another player to have a turn. If a player catches at least one of the jacks, they proceed to collect the fallen jacks in increasing number whilst throwing the captured jack(s) into the air.

The publication discusses Australian children's counting-out games. Dr Howard's term 'counting-out' refers to the processes and devices utilised by children to decide - by selection or elimination - a player for a particular part in a game rather to specific games. She explores regional variations of counting-out methods such as rhymes, rituals, drawing sticks, tossing coins and races as well as their inclusion in different games.

Dr Howard discusses the Australian variants of Knucklebones, the prevalence of the game, the terminology and verbal rituals, and the procuring of the game materials. She includes detailed descriptions of the different Knucklebone figures, played by Australian children, observed or discussed during her visit. Dr Howard also investigates the historical changes, the role of imagination and the 'when, where and by whom' Knucklebones is played. She concludes by reflecting upon the future of Knucklebones games in a rapidly changing postwar environment. In addition to her own observations, Dr Howard includes written descriptions provided by teachers and some adults reminiscing on their childhood play. For example Mrs Fairlie Taylor provided Howard with written descriptions of various Knucklebone figures demonstrated by an unidentified friend. Similarly Miss Milligen, a teacher from Mt. Lawley Government School, supplied Dr Howard with descriptions of the variations played by the school's students. Teacher Mrs Jennings from Carlisle Government Primary School also reported a number of figures. \n\nOne of a collection of publications about children\u2019s folklore written by Dr Dorothy Howard.

Dr Howard explores the use of autograph albums, the small diary-sized notebooks popular with Australian children in the first half of the 20th century. She discusses the private, secretive space occupied by the albums in the world of children. Dr Howard considers the variety of inscriptions annotated by the album owners or their peers, which include rhymes, vows and verses. Drawing on examples, she describes the prevalent subject matter of the annotations, which comprise romantic rhymes and advice on love, marriage, friendship and happiness. Other rhymes are serious or admonitory in nature. Common are verses on personal attributes and best wishes, as are vows of love, loyalty and devotion and pleas for remembrance. Dr Howard also considers the category of nonsensical verses, parodies, taunting rhymes, racial stereotypes and profanities. Her research for this article was gathered from information provided by Miss Heather Giffin, Miss Milligen, Miss Jaguers, Miss Lyttle, Miss Warham and many unidentified children, who lent their albums.\n\nOne of a collection of publications about children\u2019s folklore written by Dr Dorothy Howard.

Dr Howard's discusses the variety of marble games, the terminology, the names of games and the type of marbles used by Australian children. She focuses on the ways in which marble games have changed over time, examining the prevalence, locations, surfaces, and the types of games played. Dr Howard also considers the impact on the availability of marbles during the war years, the increasing supervision of playgrounds and the standardisation of school sports curriculums on marble games. She quotes Sir Joseph Verco's reminiscences on his childhood games from 1860-1870 described in his manuscript 'Early Memories'. These earlier accounts provide a basis for comparison with the games described by unidentified children, adults and teachers gathered during Dr Howard's visit to Australia. Dr Howard concludes with reflections on the standardisation of children's games in Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, lamenting the future's probable loss of national and regional varieties. \n\nOne of a collection of publications about children\u2019s folklore written by Dr Dorothy Howard.

The article is a report of a paper presented by Dr Howard to the First General Meeting of the Victorian Institute of Education Research on 11 February 1955. Dr Howard discusses the aim of her research project to assemble a field collection representing the games and play customs of Australian children. She describes her methodology which involves the analysis of her personal observations, questionnaires, secondary sources, and interviews with children, teachers, and adults reminiscing on their childhood play. Dr Howard reports on her preliminary findings, which indicate considerable regional variety and historical change in the play ways of Australian children. More importantly, she argues that folk tradition still exists in the play of Australian children to a far greater extent that previously supposed. Dr Howard goes onto discuss the meaning and origins of the term 'folklore', the establishment of Folklore Societies and the recognition of children's games as a specific area of folklore study.

Dr Howard read the paper before the Pennsylvania Folklore Society in Pittsburgh in May 1965 and thus, it provides highlights from Australian field trip as well as discussions of the universal issues affecting children's play. She begins by describing the reasons for her Australian field trip, citing a curiosity to learn about children's games and play customs in other English speaking countries as her primary motivation. Dr Howard briefly lists the field trip's challenges before discussing the concept of folklore as a process, which changes, adapts or dies. In the case of Australian children, she considers the various factors influencing types of play such as history, climate, economy, topography, flora and fauna, Indigenous children's games, and the role of imagination. Dr Howard proceeds to describe the historical origins and symbolism of uniquely Australian children's games including 'Bushrangers and Miners', 'Prisoners Base', 'Shears', 'Toodlembuck', 'Quondongs', 'Kangaroo Hop', and 'Kookaburro' (sic). She also considers the influence of the games and play customs of Indigenous Australian children on the wider community. She highlights the hopscotch games 'Snail Hoppy' and 'Spider Web' demonstrated by Poppy ?, a student at a government school for Aboriginal children in Sydney and further elucidated by the school's headmaster Mr Williams. Dr Howard concludes with reflections on the growing trends of the standardisation and professionalisation of children's games, the urbanisation of playing environments and the increased supervision of children's play.\n\nOne of a collection of publications about children\u2019s folklore written by Dr Dorothy Howard.

Howard seeks to reform the popular perspective of education as the provision of buildings, teachers and book facts, arguing that children need space and freedom to develop their minds. Her focus is the reintroduction of unrestricted, physical activity, preferably in natural environments, in school curricula. She laments the lack of space and money allocated to the building of play grounds in public schools, arguing that the stationary, indoor nature of existing school curricula negatively impact the health of children. She argues that despite the money invested in health and the advancements of modern medicine, the population's overall wellbeing is not improving as the origins of ill health are not being effectively addressed. Using Westchester County Camps at Harmon-on-the-Hudson as an example, Howard suggests that organised camps offer a possible model for meeting the creative, physical and unstructured needs of children in a natural environment. She argues that camps offer an escape from traditions and state-led curricula and focus on the development of morals and good health. She concludes that camp principles reflect a recognition of the value of learning from nature and being outdoors, claiming such environments stimulate imagination and meet the varying needs and interests of children.\n\nOne of a collection of publications about children\u2019s folklore written by Dr Dorothy Howard.

Dr Howard considers the place of folklore in school curricula. Using examples from schools in Maryland, she demonstrates that folklore should exist not as an independent subject, but as a process integral to educational programs seeking child growth and development. Dr Howard describes the schools' demographics, in which the folklore of numerous countries is still evident but not publicly celebrated. She demonstrates the role of folklore in early childhood development in preschool years.  From their children's infancy, she claims that parents use folklore activities, such as rhymes, rope-skipping and ball-bouncing, to assist the development of physical coordination and language development. She argues that the application of folklore processes to school curricula is a logical progression, which builds on existing ways of learning. Citing examples of the use of rhymes to foster interest in poetry and oral stories to inspire creative writing, Dr Howard suggests that folklore processes can be used as a bridge to academia. The successful application of these processes is dependent on the teacher and their training.\n\nOne of a collection of publications about children\u2019s folklore written by Dr Dorothy Howard.

Dr Howard and Bishop discuss the playground rhymes, poems and autograph album annotations of American children, which are often violent, macabre, passionate or brutally humorous in nature. Using examples, the authors demonstrate that satire and criticism, particularly of adult behaviour, are common characteristics of children's rhyming as are taunts, racist comments and mockery of physical traits and the physical world. Dr Howard and Bishop consider the origins of children's rhymes which have been handed down over generations. Whilst personal and generational variations of words and phrases occur, many rhymes have little changed surviving time, distance and translation into different languages. The authors use counting-out rhymes to illustrate the timelessness of children's rhyming by tracing their origins back to early Europe. They conclude by highlighting the significance of sound, music and verbal rhythm in children's rhyming, which they argue is more important than meaning. \n\nOne of a collection of publications about children\u2019s folklore written by Dr Dorothy Howard.

Gomme's publication functions as a dictionary of children's games from Britain's Victorian era and it was originally intended to form Part One of 'A Dictionary of British Folk-Lore', however this plan was never realised.\n\nDr Howard's introduction provides general background information on Gomme, her husband fellow British folklorist Sir George Laurence Gomme, and her contribution to the field of children's folklore. Dr Howard also offers analysis of Gomme's field research. She states that the listed games were described by adults reflecting on their childhood play rather than observed by Gomme, and therefore only represent a small, literate population of polite society. Dr Howard reflects on the changing social position of children in subsequent decades. She considered the increased visibility of children's play and growing academic interest in their activities. She concludes by remarking on the value and significance of Gomme's publication, which provides an extensive record of children's games and insight into human behaviour.\n\nOne of a collection of publications about children\u2019s folklore written by Dr Dorothy Howard.
