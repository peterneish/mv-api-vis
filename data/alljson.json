Dr Howard speaks about the availability and quality of American children's literature, a topic she believes to be relevant to both Australian and American parents. She considers the wealth of quality books and authors and the ways in which children can access and enjoy this material. Dr Howard continues with her primary concern, the need to limit children's access to comic books. She discusses the role parents and teachers can play in ensuring their children read works of literary merit citing examples of successful boycotts. Dr Howard concludes with a reflection on the similarities of pedagogical debates taking place in Australia and America. \n\nOne of a collection of interviews of children\u2019s folklorist Dr Dorothy Howard in 1954-1955, as well as a lecture she delivered. Dr Howard came to Australia in 1954-55 as an American Fulbright scholar to study Australian children's folklore. She travelled across Australia for 10 months collecting children's playground rhymes, games, play artefacts, etc.  The original fieldwork she collected during this period is held in the Australian Children\u2019s Folklore Collection (ACFC) at Museum Victoria and includes index cards, letters and photographs.", "brands": [], "bibliographies": [], "classifications": ["Games & toys", "Play & childlore", "Theory & analysis"], "acknowledgement": "Donated through the Australian Government's Cultural Gifts Program.", "relatedItemIds": [], "collectingAreas": ["Childhood"], "tradeLiteraturePublicationTypes": []}, {"physicalDescription": "Typed game descriptions in black ink on paper.

Beckham addressed to Dr Dorothy Howard on 7 July 1954. In her letter to Dr Howard, Beckham describes a number of games played during her childhood in Maldon and the Mallee country in rural Victoria. She writes that all games were unsupervised and involved finding free materials in the surrounding environment. For example, the ball games 'Ducks' and 'Rotten Eggs' involved a tennis ball and many stones, the latter being plentiful in the rocky mining town of Maldon. Beckham states that she was introduced to a new set of games following her family's relocation to the dry and sandy Mallee country. She writes that Knucklebones and 'Jacks' were quiet, cool games suitable for play in the hot Mallee summers. All descriptions include the number of players involved, the equipment needed and the rules. \n\nOne of a collection of letters describing a children\u2019s game written to children\u2019s Folklorist Dorothy Howard between 1954 and 1955.

Dr Howard writes in response to a letter previously received from Dr Factor requesting information about her Australian fieldwork and subsequent American projects. Her letter serves as a prelude to Dr Factor's visit to Roswell with Naomi, providing information on her early career and view of the playground as an educational institution. Dr Howard highlights the influence of Jean Piaget and Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss on the progression of her interests, theories and methodology. She discusses her research into the relationship between teachers and their pupils, questioning the value of passive educational models in which children simply receive knowledge. Dr Howard argues that her research of the folklore of the classroom may assist in redefining this relationship and encourage new ways of teaching. \n\nAt Dr Factor's request, Dr Howard includes an accompanying, typed document titled 'Projects in Progress', which outlines her major projects following her visit to Australia. These include: 'Maryland Mennonite Children Play', 'Kissing Kin', 'Broken Bow', and 'Odyssey of a Country Teacher'. She elaborates on her study of the Mexican child Pedro Munoz in her letter. For this project Dr Howard repeatedly visited Munoz during the 1960s and 1970s to observe his play, a methodology which differed considerably from the general or in her terms \"tourist\" survey of Australian children's play traditions. Dr Howard concludes her letter with questions about Dr Factor's research and a brief outline of her various roles and contributions to a state college in Maryland and the University of Nebraska. \n\nOne of a collection of letters written to and from children\u2019s Folklorist Dr Dorothy Howard between 1954 and 1995. Dr Howard came to Australia in 1954-55 as an American Fulbright scholar to study Australian children's folklore. She travelled across Australia for 10 months collecting children's playground rhymes, games, play artefacts, etc. The original fieldwork she collected during this period is held in the Australian Children\u2019s Folklore Collection (ACFC) at Museum Victoria and includes index cards, letters and photographs.", "brands": [], "bibliographies": ["[Book] Howard, Dorothy. 1977.

After reading about Dr Howard's research project in a local newspaper, Giffen compiled a collection of games, rhymes and jingles played by children in northern Queensland, especially the region between Bowen and Cairns. In the introductory page of her letter, she considers the impact of the tropical Queensland climate on the types of games played by children, suggesting a tendency for indoor, seated games as well as highlighting the limited access to educational resources such as libraries. Giffen also mentions her personal interest in recording Australian folk stories and songs, largely gleaned from her great grandparent's generation. The subsequent five pages comprise detailed descriptions of the various games, particularly rhyming games. Two of the games 'Beamy' and 'Corners', which appear to be unique to Queensland, are accompanied by explanatory illustrations and diagrams. Giffen also provides a list of popular terminology used by children in particular games and more generally.\n\nOne of a collection of letters written to and from children\u2019s Folklorist Dr Dorothy Howard between 1954 and 1995.

Dr Howard discusses her research of the traditional games and play customs of Australian children, listing many of the names and types of play observed and recounted during her visit to public and private schools across Australia. In addition to speaking with school students and teachers, Dr Howard interviewed or corresponded with adults about their childhood memories. She also accessed memoirs and personal letters in state archives, revealing play traditions from the 1840s onward.

Her study has indicated that British games have been retained by Australian children and sometimes adapted to created uniquely Australian variants.

Dr Howard discusses her research of the traditional games and play customs of Australian children, listing many of the names and types of play observed and recounted during her visit to public and private schools across Australia. In addition to speaking with school students and teachers, Dr Howard interviewed or corresponded with adults about their childhood memories. She also accessed memoirs and personal letters in state archives, revealing play traditions from the 1840s onward. Dr Howard continues with a discussion of the key outcomes her research, namely the recording of approximately 1,000 game names currently known or played in Australia. Her study has indicated that British games have been retained by Australian children and sometimes adapted to created uniquely Australian variants. Although only a preliminary study, Dr Howard feels her research provides an opportunity to better understand a phase of child growth and development by allowing insight into how children interact, behave, learn and think.\n\nOne of a collection of interviews of children\u2019s folklorist Dr Dorothy Howard in 1954-1955, as well as a lecture she delivered.

Beales writes to Dr Howard after reading about her Australian research project in the 'School Magazine'. He discusses his teaching experience and his perception of students in Victoria, Queensland, New Zealand, England and Scotland. He writes about the popularity of Australian Rules Football amongst youth in Victoria, stating that the absence of a proper ball can be remedied with a pig's bladder or a bundle of rubbish tied together. Beales lists some games played seasonally in Victoria including spinning tops and the marbles game 'Allies'. He states that other games such as 'Fly the Garter', 'Egg Cap', 'Kick the Tins', 'Duck Stone', 'Prisoner's Base', Rounders, Hockey Australian Rules and hoops are played all year. Beales continues with an analysis of the impact of Roman Catholic schooling on the behaviour and games played by children in Queensland. In conclusion, he discusses his own 'Scottish' style of education, which encouraged children to pursue their interests and skills irrespective of the standard curriculum. \n\nOne of a collection of letters written to and from children\u2019s Folklorist Dr Dorothy Howard between 1954 and 1995.

Cordell and addressed to Dr Dorothy Howard on 8 July 1954. Mrs Cordell provides details of popular girls games played at school during her childhood in New Norfolk, Tasmania, circa 1910. She describes the singing and chanting games 'Here We Go Around the Mulberry Bush', 'Oranges and Lemons' and 'In and Out the Windows', transcribing the accompanying rhymes and their associated physical actions. She discusses briefly the ball and bat game 'Rounders' and a hopscotch pattern, noting that the latter involved a chalk drawn square and a small piece of wood. Commenting on the cold climate of Tasmania, Mrs Cordell states that rope skipping games, such as 'Dutch and German', were popular ways of keeping warm. A similarly functional game, she describes 'Prisoners', which involves two teams of equal numbers lined up opposite each other. A row of stones is placed behind one group, which the opposing team must try to obtain without being caught and taken 'prisoner'.\n\nOne of a collection of letters describing a children\u2019s games written to children\u2019s Folklorist Dorothy Howard between 1954 and 1955.

Amos provides general descriptions of Hopscotch and 'Treasure Hunt' before discussing the games in detail. She states that Hopscotch is a popular girls game played during winter in the school grounds. Amos writes that 'Treasure Hunt' is played by boys and girls in the summer months in the back gardens of children's homes. She lists some of the friends who also play these games including Dawn Duffy, Pamela Watson and Carole Campbell. \n\nAmos describes the hopscotch patterns 'Snail Hop Scotch' and 'Aeroplane Hop Scotch' in detail, providing annotated, hand drawn diagrams of each variation. To play 'Snail Hop Scotch', Amos writes that players draw a snail-like pattern on the ground, marking bases throughout the course. As each player hops their way through the course, they write their initials in the different bases reached. Amos explains that the game continues until all the bases have been claimed by the players. She notes that landing in another player's base or on a line results in elimination from the game. Similarly, 'Aeroplane Hop Scotch' is drawn on the ground and the bases are numbered from one to eight. Players use taws, incorrectly spelt 'tores', presumably to mark out their course through the hopscotch pattern. Amos notes that players are eliminated if they land in a square occupied by another player, land in another player's base or step on a line. To play the seeking game 'Treasure Hunt', Amos writes that one player writes out a series of clues on slips of paper, which provide information about the location of a hidden treasure. The player places the clues throughout a course before providing an initial clue to the other children, who have been waiting with their eyes closed. The other players must locate each clue in order to find the final prize. Amos lists some examples of possible clues, providing an annotated diagram.\n\nOne of a collection of letters describing a children\u2019s game written to children\u2019s Folklorist Dorothy Howard between 1954 and 1955.

To play 'Giant's Treasure', she writes that a child is nominated as the 'giant', who must guard a treasure comprising a ball or stone. Taggart explains that the 'giant' stands with their treasure at their feet and their back to the approaching players, who must stand still each time the 'giant' turns around. The objective of the approaching players to steal the treasure from the 'giant' and returning to the starting line without being caught.  Similarly, 'Creepings Up' involves players slowly approaching 'he' in an attempt to touch this player. Taggart states that if 'he' sees a player move, they must return to the starting line.

Dr Howard introduces the concept of folklore, describing it as the lore of people or their traditional ways, which have been handed down orally through generations. More than just folk songs and tales, she argues that folklore encompasses beliefs, traditional customs, daily routines and her particular interest, children's play. Dr Howard explores the similarities and differences between children's games across the world before examining the play of Australian children. She discusses the common misconception that all Australian children's play traditions originated in the British Isles, citing several uniquely Australian games. Similarly, Dr Howard challenges the belief that Australian children no longer play traditional games, preferring organised sports, reading comics, watching movies or playing war games. She argues that her research indicates the continued popularity of traditional games in Australia. Dr Howard concludes with a request for people to contact her about their childhood games.\n\nOne of a collection of interviews of children\u2019s folklorist Dr Dorothy Howard in 1954-1955, as well as a lecture she delivered.

Bieske, a 21 year old man from Horsham, to Dr Dorothy Howard circa 1954-55. In his letter to Dr Howard, Bieske describes a number of games played during his childhood in rural Victoria. Bieske's descriptions include the number of players, the props involved, the rules, an instructive diagram and the games' popularity with the different genders. He comments on the seasons and locations in which particular games are played. For example Bieske describes the elimination game 'Spin the Plate', which involves players trying to retrieve a spinning play before it falls, as suitable for indoor and outdoor play particularly in winter. The individuals, G(?). Huile, Don Rushbrook, N. Linten-Smith, John Wangmann, appear to have also contributed to the description of this game. Another example of a game popular with boys in country Victoria is 'Crawling Hide and Seek'. According to Bieske, this game involves tunnelling through fields of long grass until spotted by the seeker and thus, it is a game suitable for early summer when the grass is particularly long. Bieske explains several other games including 'Quoit', 'Skittles' and the ball games 'Queenie', 'Sick, Dying, Dead' and 'Donkey'. \n\nOne of a collection of letters describing a children\u2019s game written to children\u2019s Folklorist Dorothy Howard between 1954 and 1955.

Pankervis describes 'Poison Ball' and 'Callings Up' as games requiring players aged between eight and fourteen years of age, which are played in all seasons in streets, parks and halls. To play 'Poison Ball', she states that two players stand at the far ends of a predetermined, rectangular area, as indicated by her hand drawn diagram. The players throw a ball between them, taking aim at the other children standing in the centre. If a child is hit by the passing ball, they are eliminated from the game. Pankervis explains the various scenarios which occur if the ball is caught by a player in the centre or by a child at one of the ends. Pankervis also discusses 'Callings Up', stating that each player selects a name of a plant, flower, animal, country or car. She states that a ball is thrown and a name called out. The corresponding child collects the ball and requests the other players to 'stand!'. The child attempts to throw the ball at the stationary players. If hit by the ball, the player accumulates a letter from the word 'DONKEY'. Pankervis notes that the game continues until all players have accrued the letters of 'DONKEY'. She lists other players of 'Poison Ball' and 'Callings Up' including Margaret Pankervis, John Pankervis, Judy Backhouse, Margot Wheaton, Russell Sholer, Fiona Nicolls, Diana Nicolls, Pam Prichard, Merry Hughes, David Sholer and Russell Sholer. \n\nOne of a collection of letters describing a children\u2019s game written to children\u2019s Folklorist Dorothy Howard between 1954 and 1955.

She lists some of the children she plays with including Penny Royle, Jan Moorhouse, Lyn Parker and her brother Geoff. To play, players select either 'noughts' or 'crosses', taking turns to enter these symbols into a nine square grid. Brann explains that the game's objective is to achieve a row of three, matching symbols. She provides several hand drawn diagrams illustrating different ways in which a player can win. Brann notes that if all squares have been filled and neither player has won, the game is called a 'Jack'.\n\nBrann describes a variation of the same game called 'Noughts and Crosses on Chairs'. She writes that this version is usually played indoors at social groups such as the 'Girls Friendly Society'. Instead of drawing the nine square grid on paper, players recreate the layout using chairs to represent each square. Brann provides a detailed, annotated diagram illustrating the game's configuration and the position of the players. She writes that players form two teams and each member is allocated a number. One child assumes the role of 'caller', announcing the different numbers. The corresponding children rush to secure the best chairs for their team. To differentiate between the two teams, Brann states that one team sits on the chairs and the other stands. As with 'Noughts and Crosses', the first team to secure a row of three squares is declared the winner. \n\nOne of a collection of letters describing a children\u2019s game written to children\u2019s Folklorist Dorothy Howard between 1954 and 1955.

The first child to drop the ball is pronounced 'he'. 'He' chases the other players, trying to tag them with the ball. Chapman writes that if more than four players are involved, 'he' is permitted to run with the ball. If the number is less, 'he' must stand still and throw that the ball at the running players.

Its Director is Dr June Factor, a Senior Fellow of the Australian Centre, University of Melbourne.\n\nFrom 1989 - 1999 the Collection was housed in the University of Melbourne Archives, and in June 1999 it was donated by Dr Factor to Museum Victoria, where it became a key element in the Museum's existing Childhood Collection, which is administered by the History & Technology Department. Dr Factor and Dr Davey continue to be closely involved with the Collection.\n\nAbout the Collection: The ACFC is unique, documenting contemporary children's folklore across Australia and in other countries, reaching back to the 1870s. There is also a strong component of research material from Victoria. Work of the renowned American folklorist, Dr Dorothy Howard, including significant Australian material, is included in the Collection. The ACFC is rich in the documentation of childhood in the cultures of different immigrant groups to Australia. Its contents tell of the negotiation of difference and conformity by children, and of key issues of Australian identity, particularly over the last 30 years.\n\nThe Australian Children's Folklore Collection classifies folklore as either folklore of children, or folklore for and about children, depending on whether the main persons transmitting the lore are children or adults. Folklore of children consists largely of play lore, such as rhymes, games, taunts, jokes and riddles. Folklore for and about children consists of those traditional songs, games, finger plays, stories, proverbs and sayings that are passed on informally by adults.\n\nPlay and Folklore, a publication with both overseas and Australian subscribers, is published twice a year in conjunction with the ACFC.

She writes that all games were unsupervised and involved finding free materials in the surrounding environment. For example, the ball games 'Ducks' and 'Rotten Eggs' involved a tennis ball and many stones, the latter being plentiful in the rocky mining town of Maldon. Beckham states that she was introduced to a new set of games following her family's relocation to the dry and sandy Mallee country. She writes that Knucklebones and 'Jacks' were quiet, cool games suitable for play in the hot Mallee summers.

In particular, Dr Howard seeks examples of the influence of Aboriginal games on those of non-Indigenous children. Dr Howard proceeds with questions regarding the types of games played by Aboriginal children at the Mission. She writes that Miss Roberts, an employee in the Foreign Mission Office, showed her photographs depicting children playing with leaves and an Aboriginal teacher working at the Mission.

Vickery describes the rules of the ball game 'Beam', which involves two players placed on either side of a wooden beam usually located under an elevated house. If a player's ball rebounds off the beam and they catch it, they score a point. If the ball misses the beam or passes over to the other side, the opponent scores. Park describes 'Tens' as a popular school game involving two players. Players take turns to bounce a ball in sets of declining number beginning at ten. Similarly, 'Sevens' involves bouncing a ball against a wall in groups of diminishing number beginning at seven. Described by Christison, 'Sevens' can be played by any number of girls.

She writes that players throw the knucklebones into the air, catching them alternatively in their palm or on the back of their hand. As the game progresses, more knucklebones are added into the play until all five are thrown and caught. Drake describes 'Dog and the Bone', which involves two teams of equal numbers and is played outdoors. The players are allocated numbers and line up opposite the opposing team as indicated by Drake's hand drawn diagram. In between the teams, a bone is placed. A number is called out and the corresponding players must run to grab the bone before their opposition reaches it.

Players indicate whether the seeker is getting closer to the coin's location by saying 'hot' or 'cold'.

A ring is placed on a loop of string and hidden amongst the group for the remaining child to locate. If successfully located, the child exchanges places with the bearer of the ring. Fay Hutton lists some examples of play involving coins. She writes that a coin can be tossed to determine who begins a game or coins can be thrown into a stream for children to locate. Park describes 'Heads or Tails', which involves spinning a coin and guessing which side will face upwards. Skinner describes 'Flipping the Shilling', a game which involves balancing a card with a coin on top of your middle finger.
